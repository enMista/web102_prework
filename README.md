## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had issues with typos, specifically with making the images display, but I did not know I had accidentally typed "it" somewhere in the games.js file and it was preventing the export from working properly. 

Understanding the reduce function was difficult, I honestly just went with the flow. 
Besides that, the document PDFs helped and doing the previous challenges built the necessary skills for the later challenges, so it got easier as I went on.
